# bam2egg-script
My friend made a bam2egg script for me to automate the export of .bam files into .egg files for use in blender

run the move_all_bam_to_single_folder in CMD to move everything into a single folder then move all the phase files WITH existing file paths including models into the target directory (this is to allow textures to properly load otherwise it will only be white) then run this script to convert it!\
make sure bam2egg.exe is in the same folder as the bam files!

IGNORE errors it runs!


if you cant run it due to it not being digitally signed run this command Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass
