# bam2egg-script
My friend made a egg2bam script for me to automate the export of .bam files into .egg files for use in blender

run the move_all_bam_to_single_folder in CMD to move everything into a single folder then run this script to convert it!\
make sure bam2egg.exe is in the same folder as the bam files!

IGNORE errors it runs!


if you cant run it due to it not being digitally signed run this command Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass
